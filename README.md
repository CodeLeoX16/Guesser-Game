#About the Project:
The Guesser Game is a simple console-based game implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. The game involves a Guesser and three Players. The Guesser selects a number, and the Players attempt to guess it. The Umpire manages the game by collecting inputs from the Guesser and Players, comparing the guesses, and declaring the winner(s).

#Features:

1.Interactive gameplay with user inputs for the Guesser and Players.
2.Logic to handle multiple winners or no winners.
3.Modular design with classes for Guesser, Player, and Umpire.
4.Clear and user-friendly output to display game results.
